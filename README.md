A simple ID resolver, using Swing.

Only works on exisiting configs

Makes sure that item IDs are above 4096, can be changed by using -Didres.needsBigItemID=false

Has support for NEI and InvTweaks (which use non-forge config formats)

Also ensures that extrabiomes is allocated IDs first.

<b>Run with --config=/path/to/config/folder
Don't run on existing configs (if you do, BACK THEM UP) - I HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT HAPPENS!!!

I'll write a launchery thingy soon.
