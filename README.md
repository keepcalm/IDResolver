<h1>IDResolver 1.1</h1>

Only works on exisiting (forge) configs

It will (try) to cleverly arrange your IDs so that they're all grouped.

It will put all your BlockIDs below 4096 and your ItemIDs above.

Makes sure that item IDs are above 4096, can be changed by using -Didres.needsBigItemID=false

Has support for NEI and InvTweaks (which use non-forge config formats)<br />
(by 'support' i mean 'ignores')

Also ensures that extrabiomes is allocated IDs first.

<b>Don't run on existing configs (if you do, BACK THEM UP) - I HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT HAPPENS!!!</b>
